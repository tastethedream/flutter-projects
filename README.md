# Creating a new project

 - If the project uses starter code always FORK the directory first 

 - If you accidently clone a repo inside your repo do the following

  - make sure you are inside the correct directory (the one you want to make your own)
  - remove the .git file

  `rm -r .git`

  - You should now display branch main
  - Re add, commit and push the directory to your repo
